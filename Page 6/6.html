    released in March, 2016. Lil pump has a
    great fanbase. His song “D Rose” became
    a hit and had over 20 million plays.
    Lil Pump's famiy is quite religious so
    his parents avoid public attention as
    hard as they can — no wonder that their
    names or any other information except
    for that they are both Colombian remain
    unknown to fans. Lil Pump is not the
    only child in his family but his
    siblings are out of public attention as
    well. He is teenager, not married and
    has no kids. No more information about
    his girlfriends. He has been seen in

    posted quite romantic photos online but
    he had never confirmed any serious
    relationships. Update: He is dating a
    girl named Molly Rollins. His net worth
    has been estimated at $9.5m Anyway, it
    looks Lil pump doesn’t care about
    money. He can be seen in pictures with
    cash packs in his hands. Lil pump
    crashed his expensive car, but he
    didn’t seem to be worried about the
    car. He lives in Miami, Florida. He

    rappers. Lil Pump is still specified as

    holding his Gucci Collection. Since the
    beginning of April Lil pump has started
    “fight” against famous  32 year old
